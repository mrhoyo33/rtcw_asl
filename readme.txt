Add this to LiveSplit by editing the layout and adding "Scriptable Auto Splitter". Use this file and you can split using both in-game and real time.

Segments split when a new bsp file is found.(Only NEW bsp files of the current run, moving back one level won't trigger it again).
If you want you can modify the file or just edit the checkboxes to modify which levels will split, but I recommend to just keep it as it is.
